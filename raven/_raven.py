This module provides support for authenticating users with the University of 
Cambridge Raven Authentication Service.

In the lingo of the Raven spec, this module implements a Python "Web application
agent" (WAA) capable of interacting with any given "Web login service" (WLS).
The Raven service is one such WLS. See the WAA->WLS communication protocol spec
for more details: http://raven.cam.ac.uk/project/waa2wls-protocol.txt

Raven 101
=========

In order to use this module to authenticate users, you need to have a high level
understanding of how Raven works.

Unlike many other authentication systems, a web server authenticating users 
never contacts the Raven service directly. Instead, all communication is 
directed via the user who is authenticating. A typical authentication works like
this:

1. A user requests a page on your web server which requires authentication.
   Rather than serve them the page, you redirect them to the Raven login page.
2. The user logs in at the Raven login page (your website never sees any 
   passwords).
3. Assuming the login was successful, the Raven server redirects the user back
   to your website. Raven embeds authentication information in the URL pointing
   to your website it redirects the user to.
4. Your website verifies that the authentication information in the URL used by
   the client is valid and considers them to be logged in if it is.

There are two parts of this process which your server handles: redirecting users
to Raven (step 1) and validating Raven's response (step 4). This module helps
with both.

Redirecting Users to Raven
--------------------------

The raven.login_url() function is used to generate a Raven login URL. Send an
HTTP 303 response with the URL returned as the value of the Location header.

Validating Raven's Response
---------------------------
The HTTP request your server receives from a client who's completed a Raven
login will include a URL query parameter named "WLS-Response". The parameter's
value is a Raven auth response string which needs validating. Public key
cryptography is used to check that the response was not changed after Raven
generated it.

To validate a response, create a Validator object, then call its
get_authenticated_user() or validate() methods, passing in the response string.

When creating a Validator you need to provide a dict containing one or more key
names mapped to RSA public keys. For convenience, Raven's current public key is
available from this module as raven.RAVEN_PUB_KEY_2, or even more conveniently
as raven.RAVEN_KEYS which is a dict ready to use when creating an Validator.

            login request. This is shown to the user as part of their login
            prompt.
        acceptable_auth_types: A list of authentication methods understood by
            the server that are deemed to be acceptable methods of
            authenticating the client.

        reauthenticate: Require a re-authentication exchange with the auth
            service if not None. A value of "interactive" requires the user to
            re-authenticate with the auth service (e.g. login). A value of
            "noninteractive" requires the auth service validate the user's
            identity without prompting them to login in any way. If this is not
            possible, the authentication does not succeed.
        data: A string of data which will be included in the authentication
            response passed to the post_login_url. Note that this data is under
            the control of the user.
    Returns:
        A URL which will initiate an authentication exchange when requested by
        a web browser. Typically a website user is redirected to such a URL in
        order to initiate a Raven login.
