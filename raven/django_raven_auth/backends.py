            expected_data: The authentication will only succeed if the data in 
                the signed response is equal to this value. This can be used to
                protect against "login CSRF" attacks by ensuring a Raven auth 
                response was in response to one originating from the Django app.
            expected_url: If provided, the authentication will only succeed if
                the URL in the auth response matches this argument. Can safely
                be ignored.
            keys_override: A dict of name -> public key mappings to pass to the
                raven.Validator. If not provided the RAVEN_KEYS settings value
                is used. If that has no value then raven.RAVEN_KEYS is used.

            None if the auth response was invalid, or didn't represent a 
            successful authentication, otherwise a User object representing the
            authenticated user.
